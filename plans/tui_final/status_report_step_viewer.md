# Status Report: `openhcs/tui/step_viewer.py`

**Date of Review:** 2025-05-22

**Overall Assessment:** This file contains a substantial and fairly functional implementation of the `StepViewerPane` class, designed to display and manage pipeline steps for a selected plate.

## Key Features Implemented:

*   **Asynchronous Initialization:**
    *   Employs an async factory pattern: `@classmethod async def create(cls, state, context)` which calls an `async def setup(self)` method. This allows for asynchronous operations during component setup (e.g., UI creation that might depend on an active event loop).

*   **UI Components and Display:**
    *   The primary UI element is a `TextArea` (`self.step_list`) for displaying the list of steps.
    *   Includes buttons for "Edit Step", "Add Step", "Remove Step", "Move Up", and "Move Down".
    *   `_format_step_list()`: Dynamically formats the step list, showing status icons, selection indicators, step names, a representation of the function pattern, and output memory type. Steps are visually grouped by their parent pipeline.

*   **Data Handling and State Interaction:**
    *   Listens for `'plate_selected'` events from `TUIState` to know which plate's steps to display.
    *   `_load_steps_for_plate()`: Fetches pipeline definitions and step lists for the selected plate from the `ProcessingContext` (using `context.list_pipelines_for_plate()` and `context.list_steps_for_plate()`).
    *   Performs basic structural validation on the loaded step data to ensure required fields are present for rendering.
    *   Manages an internal list of steps (`self.steps`) and associated pipeline information (`self.pipelines`, `self.pipeline_lookup`).
    *   Uses an `asyncio.Lock` (`self.steps_lock`) for thread-safe modifications to the internal step list.
    *   Listens for `'steps_updated'` events from `TUIState` to trigger a refresh of its display.

*   **Interactivity and Step Manipulation:**
    *   Supports keyboard navigation (up/down arrows) within the step list.
    *   Enter key selects a step, triggering `self.state.set_selected_step(step)`.
    *   `_edit_step()`: Notifies `TUIState` with an `'edit_step'` event, passing the selected step data (intended to trigger the `FunctionPatternEditor`).
    *   `_add_step()`: Contains placeholder logic for adding a new step, noting that it would typically involve a dialog.
    *   `_remove_step()`: Removes the selected step from its internal list and updates the UI.
    *   `_move_step_up()` and `_move_step_down()`: Allow reordering of steps within the same pipeline, notifying `TUIState` of `'steps_reordered'`.

## Apparent Completeness:

The component is **well-developed** with core functionalities for displaying, navigating, selecting, and performing basic manipulations (reordering, removal, stubbed addition) on pipeline steps. Its interaction with `TUIState` and `ProcessingContext` for data flow is clearly defined.

## Potential Remaining Work or Areas for Review:

1.  **Async Initialization Integration:**
    *   The most significant challenge is integrating the `StepViewerPane.create` async factory method into `OpenHCSTUI`'s current synchronous component initialization process (`_validate_components_present`). This will require architectural adjustments in how `OpenHCSTUI` instantiates and manages `StepViewerPane` (e.g., deferred async initialization).

2.  **`_add_step()` Full Implementation:**
    *   The "Add Step" functionality is currently a stub. This needs to be fully implemented, likely involving:
        *   A new dialog (or use of a generic step configuration dialog) to define the new step's properties (name, function pattern, memory types, etc.).
        *   Logic to correctly insert the new step into the `self.steps` list and ensure this change is propagated to the underlying pipeline definition (likely via `TUIState` events and `PipelineOrchestrator`).

3.  **Persistence of Step Changes:**
    *   While the UI allows for reordering, adding (stubbed), and removing steps, the mechanism for persisting these structural pipeline changes (e.g., saving to a plan file or updating an in-memory model managed by `PipelineOrchestrator`) is external to this component and needs to be ensured through the event system.

4.  **Error Handling and User Feedback:**
    *   While basic step validation exists, enhancing error handling for issues like invalid data from `ProcessingContext` or failures during step manipulation with more specific user feedback within the `StepViewerPane` could improve usability.

5.  **Interaction with `FunctionPatternEditor`:**
    *   The `'edit_step'` notification mechanism needs to be robustly connected to `OpenHCSTUI`'s logic for displaying the `FunctionPatternEditor` with the correct step data.

6.  **Assumptions about `ProcessingContext` API:**
    *   The component relies heavily on `context.list_pipelines_for_plate()` and `context.list_steps_for_plate()`. The stability, performance, and exact data structure (including all required fields like `status`, `pipeline_id`, `output_memory_type`) returned by these methods are critical for the `StepViewerPane` to function correctly.

Overall, [`openhcs/tui/step_viewer.py`](openhcs/tui/step_viewer.py:1) is a key component with a strong existing implementation. Addressing the async initialization and fully implementing step addition are the major next steps for this pane after basic integration.
