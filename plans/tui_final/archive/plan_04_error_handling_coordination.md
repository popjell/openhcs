## Component: Unified Error Handling and User Feedback

### Objective
Establish a comprehensive error handling system that properly propagates errors from orchestrator operations through commands to UI components, with consistent user feedback and recovery mechanisms.

### Plan
1. **Analyze Current Error Handling Patterns (45 minutes)**
   - Map error handling in orchestrator operations
   - Trace error propagation through command system
   - Identify UI error feedback mechanisms
   - Document current error recovery patterns

2. **Standardize Error Event System (1 hour)**
   - Define canonical error event signatures
   - Create error severity classification system
   - Implement error context preservation
   - Add error correlation tracking

3. **Implement Error Coordination Service (1.5 hours)**
   - Create ErrorCoordinationService for centralized error handling
   - Add error aggregation for multi-plate operations
   - Implement error recovery suggestions
   - Add error logging and debugging support

4. **Enhance Component Error Integration (2 hours)**
   - Fix command error propagation to StatusBar
   - Ensure orchestrator errors update plate status
   - Add user-friendly error dialogs
   - Implement error state recovery

5. **Add Error Recovery Mechanisms (1 hour)**
   - Implement automatic retry for transient errors
   - Add manual recovery options for user errors
   - Create error state cleanup procedures
   - Test error recovery scenarios

### Findings

#### Current Error Handling Analysis

**Orchestrator Error Patterns (HIGH CONFIDENCE)**
- PipelineOrchestrator methods raise exceptions for failures
- Compilation errors include detailed validation information
- Initialization errors include filesystem and configuration issues
- Execution errors include processing and GPU-related failures

**Command Error Handling (MEDIUM CONFIDENCE)**
- Commands wrap orchestrator calls in try/catch blocks
- Enhanced compilation command has good error handling
- Basic commands may have inconsistent error handling
- Error propagation to UI varies by command

**UI Error Feedback (MEDIUM CONFIDENCE)**
- StatusBar has error display capabilities
- Message dialogs used for some error feedback
- Plate status can show error states
- Error details may not always reach user

#### Critical Error Handling Issues

**Issue 1: Inconsistent Error Propagation**
- Some errors caught and logged but not shown to user
- Error events may not reach all interested components
- Error context lost during propagation
- Async error handling may miss some failures

**Issue 2: Poor User Error Experience**
- Technical error messages shown directly to user
- No guidance on how to fix errors
- Error recovery options not provided
- Multiple errors may overwhelm user interface

**Issue 3: Error State Management**
- Failed operations may leave system in inconsistent state
- Error status may not clear properly after recovery
- Partial failures in multi-plate operations unclear
- Error history not maintained for debugging

**Issue 4: Missing Error Recovery**
- No automatic retry mechanisms
- Manual recovery procedures unclear
- Error state cleanup incomplete
- No rollback mechanisms for failed operations

#### Component Error Integration Analysis

**Command Error Handling (60% confidence)**
- EnhancedCompilePlatesCommand has good error handling
- Basic commands have inconsistent patterns
- Error events emitted but propagation unclear
- User feedback varies by command

**StatusBar Error Display (75% confidence)**
- Can display error messages
- Has error priority system
- Integration with error events unclear
- Error persistence and clearing unclear

**PlateManagerPane Error Handling (50% confidence)**
- Validation errors handled in service layer
- Error display in UI unclear
- Error recovery mechanisms unclear
- Error state synchronization unclear

**Orchestrator Error Patterns (80% confidence)**
- Clear exception patterns for different error types
- Good error context in exception messages
- Consistent error raising across operations
- Error details suitable for debugging

#### Error Handling Confidence Assessment
- **Error Detection**: 85% - Orchestrators raise clear exceptions
- **Error Propagation**: 45% - Inconsistent command handling
- **User Feedback**: 40% - Some mechanisms exist but incomplete
- **Error Recovery**: 25% - Limited recovery mechanisms
- **Error State Management**: 30% - Basic patterns but gaps exist

### Implementation Draft
*Implementation will be added after smell loop approval*
