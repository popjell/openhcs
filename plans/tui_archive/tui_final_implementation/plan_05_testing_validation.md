## Component: Testing and Validation of Complete TUI Implementation

### Objective
Thoroughly test the complete TUI implementation to ensure all functionality works according to the specification. Validate that the DNA-identified issues are resolved and all workflows function correctly.

### Plan
1. **Test File Browser Functionality**
   - Verify add plate dialog opens and responds to button clicks
   - Test directory navigation with keyboard and mouse
   - Validate file/directory selection and callback execution
   - Confirm escape key properly closes dialogs
   - Test directory browser for step input/output configuration

2. **Test Complete Plate Management Workflow**
   - **Add Plate**: Select directory → verify orchestrator creation → confirm `?` status
   - **Initialize**: Click init button → verify `orchestrator.initialize()` call → confirm `!` status
   - **Compile**: Click compile → verify pipeline compilation → confirm `o` status
   - **Run**: Click run → verify pipeline execution → monitor progress
   - **Delete**: Select plate → click delete → verify removal from state

3. **Test Pipeline Editing Workflow**
   - **Add Step**: Click add → verify new step creation → confirm in pipeline list
   - **Edit Step**: Click edit → verify dual editor replacement → test step/func toggle
   - **Save/Close**: Test save button → verify step updates → test close restoration
   - **Load/Save Pipeline**: Test file operations → verify pipeline persistence

4. **Test Layout and Navigation**
   - Verify 3-bar layout renders correctly
   - Test pane replacement during step editing
   - Validate focus management and keyboard navigation
   - Test responsive behavior with different terminal sizes

5. **Test Integration Points**
   - Verify all buttons are clickable and functional
   - Test status bar updates and log drawer functionality
   - Validate global settings and help dialogs
   - Test error handling and user feedback

6. **Performance and Stability Testing**
   - Test with multiple plates and complex pipelines
   - Verify memory usage and resource cleanup
   - Test concurrent operations and state consistency
   - Validate proper shutdown and cleanup

### Findings
**Critical Test Areas:**
- File browser button functionality (DNA-identified issue)
- Complete plate lifecycle workflows
- Pipeline editing and step configuration
- Layout management and pane replacement
- State synchronization and UI updates

**Success Criteria:**
- All buttons respond to clicks and perform expected actions
- File dialogs open, navigate, and close properly
- Plate status indicators update correctly through lifecycle
- Pipeline editing works with proper dual editor integration
- No crashes or hangs during normal operation

**Test Environment Setup:**
- Create test directories for plate selection
- Prepare sample pipeline configurations
- Set up logging to capture any errors
- Use DNA analysis to verify complexity reduction

### Implementation Draft
*Implementation will be added after smell loop approval*
