# Semantic Matrix Analyzer Development Plans Summary

This document summarizes the development plans for the Semantic Matrix Analyzer (SMA), a tool designed to be universally applicable to any codebase while reducing cognitive load for humans and increasing correctness through AI agents bounded by semantic and AST correctness.

## Core Principles

1. **Universal Applicability**: Works with any codebase, regardless of language, framework, or size
2. **Cognitive Load Reduction**: Users express concerns in natural language without understanding technical details
3. **Bounded Correctness**: AI agents are constrained by semantic and AST correctness
4. **Clarity First**: Clear communication and documentation take precedence over all other concerns

## Total Development Timeline

- **Phase 1**: 57 weeks (13 months)
- **Phase 2**: 46 weeks (10.5 months)
- **Phase 3**: 38 weeks (8.5 months)

**Total**: 141 weeks (32 months)

Note: These timelines are sequential. With parallel development, the total timeline could be reduced significantly.

## Next Steps

1. Begin implementation of Plan 01 (Multi-Language Support) and Plan 02 (Plugin System Enhancement) in parallel
2. Develop a detailed test plan for each component
3. Create a project management structure with milestones and deliverables
4. Establish a feedback mechanism for early adopters
