# Conversation Memory Examples

This directory contains a series of progressively more complex examples demonstrating how the Conversation Memory System works with an agent and how it reduces cognitive load while increasing accuracy.

## Overview

The Conversation Memory System is designed to:

1. **Store and retrieve conversations** between users and AI agents
2. **Extract intents** from these conversations
3. **Build a knowledge graph** of intents, patterns, and preferences
4. **Maintain context** across conversation sessions
5. **Augment AI agents** with memory capabilities

These examples demonstrate how these capabilities can be used to reduce cognitive load for users while increasing the accuracy of AI-assisted code analysis and development.

## Examples

The examples are organized in order of increasing complexity:

1. **01_basic_memory.py**: Demonstrates basic conversation storage and retrieval
2. **02_intent_extraction.py**: Shows how intents are extracted from conversations
3. **03_knowledge_graph.py**: Illustrates knowledge graph construction and querying
4. **04_context_persistence.py**: Demonstrates context persistence across conversation sessions
5. **05_code_analysis.py**: Shows how conversation memory improves code analysis
6. **06_refactoring_assistant.py**: Demonstrates a refactoring assistant that remembers user preferences
7. **07_multi_session_project.py**: Illustrates a multi-session project with persistent memory

## Running the Examples

To run an example, use the following command:

```bash
python examples/conversation_memory_examples/01_basic_memory.py
```

Each example includes detailed comments explaining what's happening and how the Conversation Memory System is reducing cognitive load and increasing accuracy.

## Key Benefits Demonstrated

### Reduced Cognitive Load

- **No repetition**: Users don't need to repeat their concerns and preferences
- **Contextual references**: Users can refer to previous conversations
- **Preference memory**: The system remembers user preferences
- **Implicit understanding**: The system understands implicit concerns based on past conversations

### Increased Accuracy

- **Accumulated knowledge**: Analysis improves over time based on accumulated knowledge
- **Personalized recommendations**: Recommendations are tailored to user preferences
- **Context-aware analysis**: Analysis takes into account the full context of the project
- **Intent-driven focus**: The system focuses on what matters most to the user
