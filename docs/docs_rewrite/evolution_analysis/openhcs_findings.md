# OpenHCS Evolution Analysis

... [previous content unchanged up to Detailed Module Analysis] ...

### Experimental Processing Backends
OpenHCS supports experimental processing backends through specialized modules:
- **Framework-specific processors**: 
  - `cupy_processor.py`, `jax_processor.py`, `torch_processor.py`
  - Implement framework-specific optimizations
- **Algorithm implementations**:
  - MIST algorithm for position generation (`mist_processor_cupy.py`)
  - Self-supervised 2D deconvolution (`self_supervised_2d_deconvolution.py`)
- **Pattern**:
  - Backends implement standardized processing interfaces
  - Can be dynamically registered in processing pipelines
  - Allow researchers to prototype new algorithms

### Plugin Extension Mechanisms
The system provides extension points through:
- **Registry patterns**: 
  - Function registry (`func_registry.py`)
  - Storage backend registry (I/O systems)
  - Memory tracker registry
- **Configuration hooks**:
  - `GlobalPipelineConfig` includes plugin_settings field
  - Allows custom configuration for experimental features
- **Abstract base classes**:
  - Storage backends implement `BaseStorageBackend`
  - Processing backends implement standardized interfaces
- **Discovery system**:
  - Schema-based registration (TOML files)
  - Dynamic loading of plugins

## Scope and Limitations
This analysis provides comprehensive coverage of OpenHCS's core architecture:
- **Covered**: All fundamental subsystems including configuration management, context handling, pipeline compilation, GPU/memory management, I/O systems, microscope integration, visualization, experimental backends, and plugin mechanisms
- **Examined**: Critical design patterns and doctrine implementations throughout the system
- **Verified**: Inter-module relationships and data flow between components
- **Not Included**: 
  - UI components (Textual TUI implementation)
  - Test infrastructure
  - Deployment configurations
