## Findings

### Investigation 1: 4-Phase Compilation System Deep Dive

**Area**: Pipeline Compilation Architecture
**Key Discoveries**:

1. **Actually 5-Phase System** (not 4 as I documented):
   - Phase 1: `initialize_step_plans_for_context()` - Path planning and special I/O
   - Phase 2: `declare_zarr_stores_for_context()` - ZARR store declarations
   - Phase 3: `plan_materialization_flags_for_context()` - Materialization planning
   - Phase 4: `validate_memory_contracts_for_context()` - Memory contract validation
   - Phase 5: `assign_gpu_resources_for_context()` - GPU resource assignment

2. **Compilation Creates Immutable Contexts**: After compilation, contexts are frozen and become immutable for thread-safe parallel execution

3. **Stateless Step Objects**: After compilation, step objects are stripped of attributes and become pure templates - all configuration lives in `context.step_plans[step_id]`

4. **VFS-Based Data Flow**: No direct data passing between steps - all data flows through VFS paths specified in step_plans

5. **Special Multiprocessing Handling**: `update_step_ids_for_multiprocessing()` handles step ID remapping when contexts are pickled/unpickled

**Code References**:
- `openhcs/core/orchestrator/orchestrator.py:329-402` - Main compilation workflow
- `openhcs/core/pipeline/compiler.py:45-432` - PipelineCompiler implementation
- `docs/architecture/compilation-system-detailed.md` - Detailed architecture docs

**Documentation Implications**:
- Need to correct "4-phase" to "5-phase" in concepts documentation
- Should emphasize the immutability and thread-safety aspects more
- Need to better explain the stateless step object concept

### Investigation 2: Function Registry & Memory Type System Deep Dive

**Area**: Function Discovery, Registration, and Memory Type Conversion
**Key Discoveries**:

1. **Two-Phase Function Discovery**:
   - Phase 1: `_scan_and_register_functions()` - Scans openhcs.processing directory for native functions
   - Phase 2: `_register_external_libraries()` - Registers external library functions (scikit-image, etc.)
   - Functions must have `input_memory_type` and `output_memory_type` attributes to be registered

2. **Memory Type Decorators System**:
   - `@numpy`, `@cupy`, `@torch`, `@jax`, `@pyclesperanto` decorators set memory type attributes
   - `@memory_types(input_type="X", output_type="Y")` for mixed input/output types
   - Automatic thread-local CUDA stream management for GPU frameworks
   - Built-in OOM (Out of Memory) recovery mechanisms

3. **Automatic Memory Conversion**:
   - Zero-copy conversions using DLPack when possible (GPU-to-GPU)
   - CPU roundtrip fallback when direct conversion fails
   - Conversion functions in `openhcs/core/memory/conversion_functions.py`
   - Support for CUDA array interface for efficient GPU memory sharing

4. **Function Registry Structure**:
   - `FUNC_REGISTRY[memory_type] = [list_of_functions]` organization
   - Thread-safe with `_registry_lock`
   - Auto-initialization on first access
   - 574+ functions across multiple memory types

5. **Memory Type Validation**:
   - Functions validated during registration for matching input/output types
   - `VALID_MEMORY_TYPES` constant defines supported types
   - Registry provides `get_functions_by_memory_type()` for lookup

**Code References**:
- `openhcs/processing/func_registry.py:145-485` - Function discovery and registration
- `openhcs/core/memory/decorators.py:1-541` - Memory type decorators
- `openhcs/core/memory/conversion_functions.py` - Memory type conversion implementations

**Documentation Implications**:
- Should better explain the two-phase discovery process
- Need to document the decorator system more thoroughly
- Should explain zero-copy vs CPU roundtrip conversion strategies
- Need to emphasize the automatic nature of memory type conversion

### Investigation 3: TUI Integration & Script Generation Deep Dive

**Area**: TUI Workflow and Code Generation System
**Key Discoveries**:

1. **TUI Architecture**:
   - Built with Textual framework for SSH compatibility
   - Main components: PlateManager, PipelineEditor, ExecutionMonitor, FileBrowser
   - Window-based interface with Alt-Tab switching (temporarily disabled)
   - Real-time monitoring with professional log streaming

2. **Script Generation Workflow**:
   - "Code" button in PipelineEditor calls `action_code_pipeline()`
   - Uses `openhcs.debug.pickle_to_python` module for script generation
   - Two main functions: `generate_pipeline_repr()` for editing, `generate_orchestrator_repr()` for full scripts
   - Creates temporary pickle files and uses existing conversion logic

3. **Pipeline Configuration Process**:
   - TUI builds pipeline steps interactively in PipelineEditor
   - Steps stored as list of FunctionStep objects with parameters
   - Global configuration managed through app.global_config
   - Plate paths selected through PlateManager widget

4. **Code Export Mechanisms**:
   - `_generate_executable_script()` creates full executable scripts using pickle_to_python
   - `_generate_orchestrator_script()` creates orchestrator-specific code
   - Generated scripts include all necessary imports and configuration
   - Scripts follow the exact pattern of our gold standard example

5. **TUI-to-Script Pipeline**:
   - User configures pipeline in TUI → FunctionStep objects created
   - "Code" button pressed → pickle_to_python generates Python code
   - Code includes imports, configuration, and execution logic
   - Generated script is fully executable and self-contained

**Code References**:
- `openhcs/textual_tui/widgets/plate_manager.py:1559-1757` - Code generation logic
- `openhcs/textual_tui/widgets/pipeline_editor.py:700-722` - Pipeline code editing
- `openhcs/debug/pickle_to_python.py:127-466` - Script generation functions
- `docs/source/api/tui_system.rst` - TUI system documentation

**Documentation Implications**:
- Should better explain the TUI → script generation workflow
- Need to document the pickle_to_python conversion process
- Should emphasize that TUI generates production-ready scripts
- Need to explain the relationship between TUI configuration and generated code
